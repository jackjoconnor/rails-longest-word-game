## Background & Objectives

Time to implement a "Countdown" or "Longest-word game" with a cool web-interface!

This is test Rails app with only Routing, Controllers & Views!! (no Model or DB)

Do not create your Rails app in fullstack-challenges-post-bootcamp repo.

## Specs

Let's think about the UI for our game. What do we need?

1. A page to display the game settings (random letters), with a form for the user to type a word. A button to submit this form.
2. A page receiving this form, computing the user score and displaying it.

### 1 - Routing & Controller

Using the right command line command, generate the `GamesController` with two actions `new` and `score`. The `new` action will be used to display a new random grid and a form. The form will be submitted (with `POST`) to the `score` action.

Open you `routes.rb` file and tweak the routes automatically generated by the previous command. In the end, `rails routes` should return something like this:

```bash
Prefix Verb URI Pattern      Controller#Action
   new GET  /new(.:format)   games#new
 score POST /score(.:format) games#score
```

### 2 - Generating a new game

In the `new` action of the `GamesController`, create a new `@letters` instance variable storing these random letters from the alphabet. Then display it in the view. You should get something like this:

### 3 - Submitting a word

We need to add a form below the letters so that the user can fill a suggestion and submit it.

Go ahead and add a `<form />` to your view. It should `POST` to the `/score` action in the `GamesController`. Remember about the `:authenticity_token` (see Lecture slides)!

### 4 - Computing the score

Time to implement the `GamesController#score` logic. Do we have all the information at hand? What do we need? Do we need to pass more information through the `POST` request? Have a look at [`hidden_field_tag`](http://api.rubyonrails.org/v5.1/classes/ActionView/Helpers/FormTagHelper.html#method-i-hidden_field_tag).

We want to handle three scenarios:

1. The word can't be built out of the original grid
2. The word is valid according to the grid, but is not a valid English word
3. The word is valid according to the grid and is an English word

(You can use [this API](https://wagon-dictionary.herokuapp.com/) to check if a word is valid.)

At the bottom of the results, add a `link_to` to go back to the New game page.
